# UX-ray MVP Setup Guide

Welcome to UX-ray! This guide will help you set up the MVP for an AI-powered UX analysis tool.

## üöÄ What You've Built

UX-ray is an AI assistant that automatically scans websites, identifies UX problems, and provides actionable recommendations. The MVP includes:

- **Landing Page**: Compelling marketing site with pricing tiers
- **Dashboard**: Website scanning interface with history
- **AI Analysis**: Puppeteer + OpenAI for comprehensive UX audits
- **Detailed Reports**: Issues categorized by severity with implementation guides
- **Database**: Full schema with user management, scans, and recommendations

## üõ† Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Account**: [Create one here](https://supabase.com)
2. **OpenAI API Key**: [Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. **Node.js 18+**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org)

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

   # OpenAI Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

   # App Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Open your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Create a new query

2. **Run the Schema**
   - Copy the entire contents of `lib/database/schema.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to create all tables and policies

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Run this to check if tables were created
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   ```

   You should see:
   - `scans`
   - `ux_issues`
   - `recommendations`
   - `user_subscriptions`
   - `scan_usage`

## üîß Configuration Details

### Supabase Configuration
1. **Project URL**: Found in Project Settings > API
2. **Anon Key**: Found in Project Settings > API  
3. **Service Role Key**: Found in Project Settings > API (keep this secret!)

### OpenAI Configuration
1. **API Key**: Create at platform.openai.com
2. **Model**: Uses `gpt-4o-mini` for cost-effectiveness
